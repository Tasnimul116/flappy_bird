# üê¶ Flappy Bird Clone (Unity)

This is my **first Unity game project**, a simple **Flappy Bird clone** built with Unity.  
I created this project to learn the basics of Unity game development, including:

- 2D game physics
- Rigidbody2D & Colliders
- UI system (score display & game over screen)
- Prefab instantiation (pipes & obstacles)
- Simple game loop mechanics
